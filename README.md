- 👋 Hi, I’m Haley!
- 👀 I am a Talent Developer at [Skillstorm](https://www.skillstorm.com), teaching Software Development. In June 2022, I graduated from the University of Washington Web Development bootcamp. I have 6+ years of experience as a Certified Athletic Trainer at Seattle Children's Hospital (Seattle, WA). I have my Bachelor of Science degree from Chapman University (Orange, CA).
- 🌱 I am currently self-teaching Java! I'm knowledgable about React, Redux, HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery + UI, Bootstrap, Materialize, MySql, MongoDB, Node.js, and NPM packages like Sequelize, Mongoose, Inquirer, Express, and Handlebars!
