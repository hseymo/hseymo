- 👋 Hi, I’m Haley!
- 👀 I recently graduated from the University of Washington Web Development bootcamp (6/13/2022). I have 6+ years of experience as a Certified Athletic Trainer at Seattle Children's Hospital (Seattle, WA). I have my Bachelor of Science degree from Chapman University (Orange, CA).
- 🌱 I am currently self-teaching Java as I look for a job as a full-stack developer! I'm knowledgable about React, HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery + UI, Bootstrap, Materialize, MySql, MongoDB, Node.js, and NPM packages like Sequelize, Mongoose, Inquirer, Express, and Handlebars!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects with anyone who would like to gain experience as a mentor! Additionally, I would love to work on Sports Medicine, healthcare, or fitness related projects.
